This GitHub Repo highlights the importance of Responsiveness in React Native. Responsiveness on lay terms refers to when heights and widths of objects on a screen remain the same througout other screens.

We used Height Percentage and Width Percentage, along with the Get Dimensions method(which could be found in the commit messages section).

First I installed the react-native-responsive-screen dependency, before copying and pasting the require import statement(import {widthPercentageToDP as wp, heightPercentageToDP as hp} from 'react-native-responsive-screen';)
